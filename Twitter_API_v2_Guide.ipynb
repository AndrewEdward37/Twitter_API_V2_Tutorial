    "# 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end of 2020, Twitter introduced a new Twitter API built from the ground up. Twitter API v2 comes with more features and data you can pull and analyze, new endpoints and a lot of functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the introduction of that new API, Twitter also introduced a new powerful free product for academics: [The Academic Research product track](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research).\n",
    "\n",
    "The track grants free access to full-archive search and other v2 endpoints, with a volume cap of 10,000,000 tweets per month!\n",
    "If you want to know if you qualify for the track or not, check this [link](https://developer.twitter.com/en/solutions/academic-research/application-info).\n",
    "\n",
    "I have recently worked on a data analysis research project with Carnegie Mellon University using the capabilites that this track offers, and the power it gives you as a researcher is mindblowing! \n",
    "\n",
    "Yet since v2 of the API is fairly new, less resources exist if you run into issues through the process of collecting data for your research.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, in this article, we will go through a step-by-step process from setting up, accessing endpoints, to saving tweets collected in CSV format to use for analysis in the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "This article will be using an endpoint that is available only for the Academic Research track ([Full-archive Search](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference/get-tweets-search-all) endpoint), but almost everything in this guide can be applied to any other endpoint that is available for all developer accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do not have access to the Full-archive Search endpoint, you can still use follow this tutorial using the ([Recent Search](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/api-reference/get-tweets-search-recent) endpoint)"

    "- *Required endpoints:*\n",
    "\n",
    "    In the case of the full-archive search endpoint, the *query* parameter is the only parameter that is **required** to make a request. Always make sure to look at the documentation for the endpoint you are using to confirm which parameters HAVE to exist so you do not face issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Query Parameter:*\n",
    "\n",
    "    The *query* parameter is where you put the keyword(s) you want to search for. Queries can be as simple as searching for tweets containing the word \"xbox\" or as complex as \"(xbox europe) OR (xbox usa)\" which will return tweets that contain the words xbox AND europe or xbox AND usa.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Also, a *query* can be customized using *search operators*. There are so many options that help you narrow your search results. We will hopefully discuss operators more in depth in another article. For now, you can find the full list of operators for building queries [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/search/integrate/build-a-query).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example of a simple query with an operator: \"xbox lang:en\"\n",
    "    \n",

    "\n",
    "    The *end_time* and *start_time* format that Twitter uses for timestamps is *YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ (ISO 8601/RFC 3339)*. So make sure to convert the dates you want to this format. If you are unsure about how to, this is a nice [timestamp converter](https://www.timestamp-converter.com/) that will definitely help.\n",
    "    \n",

    "- *Results volume:* \n",

    "Now you might be asking, how can I get more than 500 results then? **That is where *next_token* and pagination comes to play!**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is simple: If more results exists for your query, Twitter will return a unique *next_token* that you can use in your next request and it will give you the new results.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to retrieve all the tweets that exist for your query, you just keep sending requests using the new *next_token* you receive every time, until no *next_token* exists, signaling that you have retrieved all the tweets!\n",

    "# 8. Save Results to CSV\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be asking yourself, why do we want to save the results in CSV format? The short answer is, compared to a JSON object, CSVs are a widely used format that can easily be imported into an Excel spreadsheet, database, or data visualization software.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to save the results in a table format for CSV, there are two approaches, a simple approach and a more custom approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Well...\n",
    "\n",
    "**If there is an simple approach through a Python library, why do we need the custom approach?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer to that is: The custom function will make us break-down and streamline the embedded dictionaries in some of the returned results into separate columns, making our analysis task easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the public metrics key:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\"public_metrics\": {\n",
    "                \"like_count\": 0,\n",
    "                \"quote_count\": 0,\n",
    "                \"reply_count\": 0,\n",
    "                \"retweet_count\": 0\n",
    "            },\n",
    "```\n",
    "The key returns another dictionary, the simple approach will save this how dictionary under one CSV column, while in the custom approach, we can break each into a different column before saving to the data to CSV."
